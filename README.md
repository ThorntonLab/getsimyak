#Major update

__NOTE__: These scripts are irrelevant now, as we've had issues with serving up FASTQ files from our campus cluster.

You therefore have two choices:

* Download our BAM files from the SRA using the accession numbers in the MBE paper.  If you need the FASTQ files, you can reconstruct them from the BAM files.
* Download the _D. yakuba_ data from http://devlaeminck.bio.uci.edu/Data/dyak_genomic_reads/ and the _D. simulans_ data from http://devlaeminck.bio.uci.edu/Data/dsim_genomic_reads/

The latter option could be quite slow...

#Old README content
Shell scripts to download data from Rogers et al. Landscape of standing variation for tandem duplications in *Drosophila yakuba* and *Drosophila simulans*.

These citation for these data is:

Rogers, R. L., J. M. Cridland, L. Shao, T. Hu, P. Andolfatto and K. R. Thornton (accepted, Molecular Biology and Evolution) Landscape of standing variation for tandem duplications in Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila simulans.

A preprint of the paper is on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7371).
